     <q>
       Always assume that your opponent is going to be bigger, stronger, and faster than you; so that you learn to rely on technique, timing and leverage, rather than brute strength.
     </q> - Helio Gracie.

   <p>Before, If you sought specific knowledge, one would need to travel to remote pockets of brazil, to learn Brazilian Jiujitsu, or Japan if you wanted traditional Jiu-Jitsu. Seek out a grandmaster whom they would have to prove dedication to learning the arts. That was until Helio Gracie and his brothers, Carlos, and George. Founded the martial art of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. With the help of Oswaldo Fadda and Luiz Franca, two other student, founded the martial art known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

    <br>

     Learning modern day Jiu-Jitsu is one of the most humbling, exciting, and fun things someone can do, from first hand experience, I am looking forward to continuing my training aswell.
